# Overview of RAG
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances the performance of foundation models (FMs) by incorporating knowledge from external sources. FMs are trained on vast datasets to generate coherent and original text for various tasks, such as answering questions, translating languages, and completing sentences. However, the information available within their training data can be limited or outdated.

RAG addresses this limitation by incorporating relevant information from external data sources before generating a response. This approach allows the FM to produce relevant, accurate, and contextually appropriate output, without the need to retrain the entire model.

RAG represents a cost-effective solution for organizations looking to tailor the capabilities of FMs to their specific domains or internal knowledge bases.

Issues can be solved by RAG:
- Issues with facts
- Outdated information
- Unreliable sources
- Terminology confusion

# Use cases
Overall, RAG's ability to augment foundation models (FMs) with external knowledge sources makes it a versatile technology e.g:
- ChatBot
- Conversational AI
- Fact & verification checking
- Content generation
- Data analytic
